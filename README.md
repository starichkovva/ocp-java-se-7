# Code examples for Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 7
This repository contains examples I used to prepare for certification exam.

Most of examples are simple Java classes.
You can run them passing proper code as a program argument:

<pre><code>java -jar ocp-java-se-7-&lt;version&gt;.jar [valid_code]</code></pre>

Valid example codes can be found in:

<pre><code>org.starichkov.java.ocp.Examples</code></pre>

Some of examples are (or have) JUnit tests, so use following Maven goal to run them:

<pre><code>mvn test</code></pre>

And some of examples are non-runnable Java files - just for 'look and study' purposes.
